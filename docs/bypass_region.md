# Bypass GitLab Region Restrictions

This is a guide on how to bypass GitLab region restrictions. GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager that allows your team to collaborate on code, test, and deploy applications. However, GitLab may be blocked in certain regions due to government censorship or corporate firewalls. If you find yourself in a region where GitLab is blocked, you can use a VPN or proxy to bypass these restrictions.
